# CryptoClustering:
AI Module 11 Challenge

## Challenge Objective:
The objective  of this challenge was to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes using the K-means and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. The analysis will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year. This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/Ebylisa/CryptoClustering).

## Code Summary:
(1) - A repository was created called CryptoClustering in Git hub and the starter code  Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb was downloaded on the local Git repository and pushed to GitHub. (2) - The csv file crypto_market_data.csv was imported for the data analysis and was read into a Dataframe and indexed on "coin_id". (3) - The dataset was viewed using the df.describe function. (4) - The dataset was then normalized/scaled and converted to a dataframe using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn. (5) - The best value for K was determined using the scaled dataframe and plotting the k-value. (8) The KMeans Model was used then using clusters and plotted. (9)  The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods was applied to optimize clusters to reduce. (10) - The best value for K was determined using  PCA method and the data was plotted using the elbow curve. (11) Error .
